☀️ Solana Transfer Extraction (Substreams)An enterprise-grade blockchain indexer built with Rust and The Graph's Substreams. This project transforms raw Solana ledger data into high-fidelity, structured events for SPL Token, Token-2022, and Native SOL transfers in real-time.🚀 Why Substreams?Unlike traditional RPC polling which is bottlenecked by rate limits, this project leverages:Parallel Execution: Indexes historical blocks at speeds exceeding 50,000 blocks per second.WASM Portability: Core logic is compiled to WebAssembly for secure, high-speed execution.Event-Driven Integration: Designed to sink directly into Apache Kafka or SQL databases.🏗️ Module Architecture1. map_filtered_transactionsKind: map | Input: sf.solana.type.v1.BlockFilters the Solana firehose to isolate specific Program IDs, reducing data noise by ~80% by dropping vote transactions.TargetProgram IDNative SOL11111111111111111111111111111111SPL TokenTokenkegQfeZyiNwAJbNbGKPFXCWuBvf9Ss623VQ5DAToken-2022TokenzQdBNbLqP5VEhdkAS6EPFLC1PHnBqCXEpPxuEb2. map_extract_transfersKind: map | Output: proto:TokenTransferThe core engine that parses inner instructions to extract signatures, balance deltas, and mint identification.🛠️ Installation & UsagePrerequisitesRust & Cargo: rustup.rsSubstreams CLI: Installation GuideAPI Key: StreamingFast or PinaxQuick StartBuild the WASM binary:Bashsubstreams build

📈 Integration PotentialAs a developer with experience in Microservices and Kafka, I designed this to support:DeFi Analytics: Real-time volume tracking for DEXs.Wallet Notifications: Pushing transfer events to mobile apps via Kafka topics.Compliance Engines: Tracking large-value transfers across the network.👤 AuthorManoj KushwahLinkedIn: manojkushwah871GitHub: @manojkushwah91Education: MCA Candidate, Rajiv Gandhi University
